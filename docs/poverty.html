   <p>As the trip progressed, a family friend that was on the trip with me decided they wanted to leave the resort in order to get “authentic” Jamaican food. This is when I began to panic. I immediately remembered a story my friend told me about his father. He was at a resort in Jamaica, until his father left the resort in order to try authentic Jamaican cuisine. He never returned. After departing, my friend’s father entered Kingston, Jamaica and was unfortunately stabbed to death by one of the locals. This further proves that Jamaica is extremely unsafe, and attempts to hide this from the public in order to attract tourists.</p>

   <p>I further grew to the realization that this resort, as well as the other resorts that appear on the internet when searching about Jamaica do not represent this country as a whole. In fact, with a simple Google search of Jamaica, after clicking on “images,” only beautiful photographs appear. This geographic representation could not be any more far off from the actual country as a whole.</p>

<p>Entering The Ghetto in Kingston, Jamaica</p>

<p>The video above accurately depicts this “beautiful” Caribbean country as a whole. The geographical radius of the “ghetto” areas in Jamaica are far greater than the safe ones. The slums in Kingston, Jamaica (which is the country’s capital), as pictured in the video, stems from years of economic turmoil as a result of the terrible crime. According to the International Trade Administration, “Crime and corruption remain significant concerns in Jamaica, with the security measures associated with the former adding considerably to the cost of doing business.” Additionally, this said crime, which could be a result of the economic struggles of the country is thought of as being unmitigatable. In the late 90s, the Jamaican government was actually able to reduce the poverty rate with newly introduced liberalization laws. However, the sustainability of this new lower poverty rate proved to be unstable.  “During 1989–1993 when the Jamaican economy underwent the most drastic liberalization policies, inequality and poverty declined, although there were sharp jumps in both inequality and poverty in 1991 when financial liberalization occurred. The overall decline in poverty is attributed to the strong performance of domestic agriculture and the increased inflow of remittances, and seems unlikely to be sustained.” (Handa 1998). The Jamaican economy has been fluctuating for years due to the government’s negligence towards the citizens of Jamaica. This has led to years of poverty and socioeconomic struggles.</p>
