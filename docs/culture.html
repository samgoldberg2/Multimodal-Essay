<p>Despite the slummy areas, high crime rate, and poor government body, Jamaica has a very unique and beautiful culture that is worth exploring. The deeply rooted cultural practices in Jamaica are a direct result of the former rule of Spanish and British rule in the country, which brought people of African descent to the land. The Jamaican people hold many unique traditions such as Nine Nights, in which white rum, bammy, and fried fish are served in order to comfort those with deceased relatives. Additionally, the Jamaican people have a distinct cuisine, unlike any other culture. For example, according to the Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia, “Jamaican dinners are cooked with intention to have company. Large meals consisting of any of the dishes listed above may be made. Scotch bonnet peppers, allspice or jerk seasoning are rubbed onto meats. Additional popular items are steamed fish, curried shrimp, tripe and beans, stew pork and curry goat, on special occasions” (Albala 2011). This is just one of many examples of the distinct cultural practices of the Jamaican people.</p>

<p>Jamaican Patwa — Country Folk</p>

<p>Overall, Jamaica is still a beautiful country, with its unique culture, cuisine, and traditions. However, it is not beautiful in the same way that tourism websites display it as. The country folk in Jamaica have a very simple, peaceful lifestyle with their own set of responsibilities and struggles. In a way, the lifestyle of the country folk in Jamaica closely resembles that of the lifestyle described to me by the employees at the resort.</p>

<p>Due to tourism, Jamaica attempts to cover up its faults, but nevertheless displays extreme beauty in other ways. With such a distinct array of people, culture, cuisine, and traditions, this country is still worth visiting. However, if ecotourism websites were to be more truthful about the “real” Jamaica, then people would know exactly what they are in for when they are visiting this unique island. Ideally, a perfect ecotourism website regarding Jamaica would show its beauty, as well as its faults, but still be able to attract tourists to this beautiful island. That way, people would appreciate the honesty of the site, know what to expect when visiting, and experience the finer cultural aspects of Jamaica.</p>

<p>As I left the resort to return home, and was once again greeted by the slummy sidewalks in between the resort and the airport, I found it strange how suddenly the transition was between the beauty of the resort and the dark, dangerous, ghetto areas adjacent to it. To me, it felt as if this was done as a means of isolating the tourists from the locals, which could result in a culture shock if one was to safely roam the streets and interact with the locals of Jamaica.</p>
