   <h2> It all started from a simple vacation</h2>

   <h3> Diving into the details of what Jamaica is truly like</h3>

   <p>On this site, you will learn about the aspects of Jamaica that is essentially hidden from you in an ecotouristic setting in order to boost tourism into the country. These travel sites are essentially putting on a front and not showcasing the the true innerworkings of this country for their own economic gain.</p>

   <p>When I was in eighth grade, after a family trip to Jamaica, something stuck with me from that vacation that I will never forget. Upon arriving in Jamaica from the airport, I noticed some of the most ghetto areas I have ever seen in my entire life. Was this where I was going to embark on a leisurely vacation? After reaching the resort, I was quickly relieved of my concerns as the slummy areas I passed in the taxi ride were now gone, and I was suddenly greeted by a beautiful, safe, beachfront resort. Despite being happier in this new safe space, I still had many questions. Why do so many people come to Jamaica despite its unsafe environment? Jamaica appeared to put on a front of a completely safe, beautiful tourism location as a means for economic gain.
</p>

<p>I vividly remember one of the employees at the resort took me near where he grew up on one of the boat rides we went on. On this trip, I realized how fortunate I am to have certain things in my possession on a daily basis. For food, I remember this man told me how he and his brothers used to climb trees and eat the nuts that grew off of them. This made me wonder whether the resort was simply using these people to please tourists, and perhaps unfairly paying their employees. The more I learned about these people’s pasts, the more concerned I grew.</p>
